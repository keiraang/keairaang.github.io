    <h2>Stories and Impact</h2>
  
    <h4 class = 'bold'>To date, there have been at least seven wrongful arrests we know of in the United States due to police reliance on incorrect facial recognition results — and those are just the known cases. In nearly every one of those instances, the person wrongfully arrested was Black. </h4>
  
    <h4 class = 'bold'>It is clear that in many cases, inaccurate facial recognition can be a life-altering mistake for people in minority groups. </h4>

    <p>Robert Williams, a Black father in suburban Detroit, was wrongly arrested three years ago after facial recognition technology incorrectly identified him as a thief. This mistake highlights a broader issue: facial recognition technology (FRT) often leads to disproportionate arrests of Black individuals due to biases in the algorithms, which are usually trained on datasets lacking sufficient representation of Black faces. These biases, combined with police officers' reliance on the supposedly infallible technology, worsen racial profiling and wrongful arrests.

                <p>Flawed facial recognition technology caused the wrongful arrest of a pregnant woman in Detroit. The stress of the situation caused her to have contractions! Porcha Woodruff is the third Black Detroit resident to be wrongfully arrested after police used facial recognition to identify an assailant. Kamau Jawawa states "Often, (Detroit Police) is cherry-picking which data they’d like to politicize. But yet when folk wrongfully arrested are consistently Black folk, it’s not common practice to interrogate the efficacy of the technology," showing that we must have awareness when it comes to this topic.</p>
<h4>Why Should We Care?</h4>
  <p class ='bottom'>Understanding and addressing racial biases in AI and technology is crucial for everyone, regardless of their direct involvement in technology development or legal systems. These biases have far-reaching consequences that impact societal fairness and equality. AI has the potential to worsen systemic discrimination, leading to unequal opportunities and outcomes for individuals based on their race, ethnicity, or other characteristics. As citizens, awareness of these biases is essential as they can influence everyday interactions with technology, employment opportunities, and access to services. Addressing these biases is not just a matter of technical or legal concern but a moral imperative to uphold principles of equity and justice in society.</p>
