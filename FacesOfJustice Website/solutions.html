    <strong><h3>What can we Do?</h3>
      
    </h3><p>Improved Training Data: Ensure that the algorithms are trained on diverse datasets that include a wide range of faces to reduce bias and improve accuracy for all racial groups.
</p>
    <p>Regular Audits: Conduct frequent independent audits of FRT systems to check for and address any biases or inaccuracies.
    Transparency: Require law enforcement agencies to be transparent about their use of FRT, including the sharing of data on its accuracy and impact on different racial groups.</p>
    <p>Strict Regulations: Implement strict regulations and guidelines for the use of FRT, including clear accountability measures for misuse or errors.</p>

    <p>Moratoriums or Bans: Consider temporary moratoriums or outright bans on the use of FRT by law enforcement until the technology is proven to be fair and reliable.</p>

    <p>Diverse Data sets: Ensure training datasets include a wide range of demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.) to reduce biases in recognition algorithms</p>

    <p>Regulation and Legislation: Advocate for policies and regulations that govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, ensuring accountability and preventing misuse.</p>

    <p>Ethical Guidelines and Standards: Develop and enforce ethical guidelines and standards for the use of facial recognition technology</p>

    <p>Public Awareness and Education: Educate the public about the potential risks of facial recognition so that one can make conscious decisions about the use of facial recognition technology.</p>
